Sensodyne Daily Care Gentle Whitening Toothpaste provides daily care and protection for sensitive teeth. This daily toothpaste provides all of the benefits of a regular toothpaste, while helping to remove stains for naturally whiter teeth. HOW DOES IT WORK? The formula delivers superior whitening action* while the minty taste leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh. Plus, the fluoride promotes oral health - strengthening teeth, promoting gum health, and protecting against tooth decay. Sensodyne is specially formulated to care for sensitive teeth. When enamel is worn away or gums recede, the dentine underneath becomes exposed. This can lead to tooth sensitivity, for example, with hot and cold food and drinks. Tooth sensitivity is not a one-off problem, but an ongoing condition that can benefit from daily specialist care. Sensodyne Daily Care toothpastes are specially formulated to provide sensitive teeth relief with all the benefits of a regular toothpaste. WHO IS IT FOR? Sensodyne Daily Care Gentle Whitening is for everyone 12 years and over who wants to gently whiten and care for their sensitive teeth. Sensodyne is the No.1 dentist recommended brand for sensitive teeth, and has been recommended by dentists for many years. *versus previous formulation ** For claim verification please contact mystory.gb@haleon.com 1.

When you are dealing with excessive sweating, you want highly effective and reliable protection that is kind to your skin. This anti-perspirant cream stick is 3x more powerful* on sweat thanks to our active technology and our TRIsolid cream formula is body responsive with a unique blend of skin-moisturising ingredients, so it's gentle enough for everyday use.

4426,258964068,Simple Kind To Eyes Eye Make-Up Remover Pads 30S,"Our Simple Kind to Skin Eye Make-Up Remover Pads effectively cleanse your eyes of make-up (including waterproof mascara) and impurities whilst instantly hydrating the skin around your eyes, making them the perfect face wipes for dehydrated, dry, or sensitive skin. Cleansing plays an important part in a healthy skincare regime. However, some eye make-up removers are harsh and can strip away natural oils, making the skin around your eyes feel tight, dry and dehydrated. This is why you should choose a cleanser for sensitive skin. Our eye pads are infused with skin-essential minerals and a plant extract and do not contain any artificial colours or perfume, or any harsh chemicals that can upset your skin. These eye pads are part of the Simple Kind to Skin range and are specifically designed to leave skin healthy and happy. Why not try out our other products in the Simple Kind to Skin range to help keep your skin hydrated? After using Simple Kind to Skin Eye Pads, we recommend cleansing your face with Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water. Finish your routine by smoothing Simple Hydrating Gel Cream into your face and neck to instantly moisturise your skin and complete your hydration skincare routine.

Your skin is left feeling clean, fresh, and instantly hydrated. Every wipe is as fresh as the first, thanks to our aqua-lock technology which helps prevent the cleansing wipes from drying out.

 Storage:<br />To keep your condoms fresh store in a cool dry place away from direct sunlight.<br /><br />Safety Warning:<br />A Note About Real Feel and Latex Allergies<br />This is a non-latex material so they are suitable for people who have an allergy to natural rubber latex proteins. We've done tests that show Durex Real Feel condoms have minimal potential for induced delayed hypersensitivity (also called ""Type IV allergy"" and ""allergic contact dermatitis""). Still, some people who are sensitive to latex may also have sensitivity to these condoms. If you do experience irritation<br />or have any allergic reaction stop using them and see a doctor.<br /><br />Remember, no method of contraception works 100% against pregnancy, HIV or sexually transmitted infections.<br /><br />Condoms may present a choking hazard.<br />Keep out of reach of children.<br /><br />JUST A FEW WARNINGS<br />Only use lubricants recommended for use with condoms.<br />Oil-based ones (petroluem jelly, baby oil and some pessaries) and some topical medicines that go on the penis or vagina can damage condom.<br />STOP USE: If you feel discomfort or irritation while using condoms.<br />Only use a condom once.<br />Reuse may increase risk of failure or infection.<br />If you use the condom for oral sex first, you should use a new condom for any other type of sex that follows.<br />For anal sex use additional lubrication (do not use Durex Tingle or Embrace) on the outside of the condom.<br /><br />WHEN TO SEEK ADVICE<br />Speak to your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure if you are allergic to latex or if irritation or discomfort persists after use or you are applying topical medicines to your penis or vagina.<br />If a condom leaks or bursts during sex consult a pharmacist or doctor as soon as possible and within 72 hours.<br /><br />Additional Information:<br />Condoms<br /><br />Certified under 93/42/EEC by SGS Belgium NV.

preparationAndUsage
 Before You Get Started<br />Only use lubricants recommended for use with condoms. For anal sex use additional lubrication (do not use durex Tingling or Embrace.) on the outside of the condom.<br /><br />To help you get it on right first time, the Durex logo on the foil shows you the bottom of the condom.<br /><br />Before You Get Going<br />Before you use this condom, check the expiry date on the condom wrapper. If the individual container is obviously damaged, throw that one away and use a new one from an undamaged package. Put a condom on before the penis touches the other person. This helps to prevent pregnancy and the possibility of catching sexually transmitted infections.<br /><br />How to Use Your Condom<br />1. Tear the wrapper open from the serrated edge. Be careful with the condom, it could get damaged by fingernails or sharp objects.<br />2. With the roll outside, squeeze the teat and place the condom on the tip of the erect penis.<br />3. Roll down to the base.<br />Stop and check if you feel the condom slipping off or too tight on the penis because this might lead to breakage. You should take the condom off soon after ejaculation.<br />Hold the condom firmly at the base of the penis before pulling out.<br />4. Throw the foil and used condom into a bin. Don't flush down the toilet.","{'bc1': 'Health, Wellbeing & Medicines', 'bc2': 'Family Planning & Sexual Health', 'bc3': 'Condoms'}",https://groceries.morrisons.com/images-v3/4b85987b-1398-4173-a0c1-3546047c9d74/8d52f0d1-0448-4364-94e0-cdf51e651958/500x500.webp,https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/durex-real-feel-non-latex-condoms/107531987,11.0,none,female,0.4699620152108896,0.12590432777285576,0.40413365701625464,0.4699620152108896,,,
