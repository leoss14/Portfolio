    <!-- SUMMARY -->
    <section class="summary-section">
        <div class="theory-box">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                This project examines whether products marketed to women are priced higher than 
                comparable products for men in UK supermarkets — the so-called "pink tax." It 
                proceeds in two stages: first, building a classifier to identify gendered products 
                from text and image features; then, running a series of regressions to estimate 
                the price gap while controlling for product category, store, and product characteristics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The classifier achieves 80% F1 using TF-IDF and color features. The regression 
                analysis finds that female products are ~9% cheaper in raw comparisons, but 
                the gap becomes statistically insignificant after controlling for product category 
                (p = 0.35). The unit price regression shows essentially zero difference (+0.7%, 
                p = 0.92). The main finding is that apparent price differences reflect category 
                composition — women's and men's products fall into different product types — 
                rather than within-category pricing discrimination.

    <!-- BACKGROUND -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Background</h2>
        
        <div class="theory-box">
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Research on the "pink tax" examines whether products marketed to women are priced 
                higher than equivalent products marketed to men. Estimating this requires labeling 
                products by target gender, but many products don't state this explicitly. Instead, 
                they signal gender through color choices, language, and brand names.
            </p>
            <p>
                With ~21,000 products in this dataset, manual labeling is impractical. This project 
                attempts automated classification, though with caveats about accuracy and the 
                inherent subjectivity of "gendered marketing."
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="theory-box">
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
                The classifier combines three feature types:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Text features:</strong> TF-IDF vectors from product descriptions (500 features) 
                and category breadcrumbs (200 features). These capture explicit gender terms ("for men"), 
                brand names (Venus, Gillette), and product categories.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Color features:</strong> Dominant colors extracted from product images using 
                K-means clustering, mapped to 31 named colors. This produces 93 binary features 
                (3 color slots × 31 colors).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Metadata:</strong> Store ID, price, and unit price (6 features).
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- DATA -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Data</h2>
        
        <div class="theory-box">
            <h3>Sources and Filtering</h3>
            <p>
                The dataset contains 21,436 products scraped from Tesco, Sainsbury's, Boots, and Superdrug. 
                I excluded categories unlikely to be gendered (food, electronics, pet supplies, cleaning 
                products), leaving 12,832 products in categories like personal care, cosmetics, and toiletries.
            </p>
            <p>
                For training labels, I used two sources: (1) explicit gender terms extracted via regex 
                from product text ("for women", "men's", etc.), yielding 1,075 female and 844 male products; 
                and (2) 259 products with human-coded labels from a separate validation exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
                The training set was balanced to 844 samples per class (female, male, neutral), with 
                neutral samples drawn from products lacking explicit gender terms.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="theory-box">
            <h3>Color Extraction</h3>
            <p>
                For 2,000 products, I downloaded images and extracted the three most dominant colors 
                using K-means clustering on pixel RGB values. Each color was then matched to the nearest 
                named color from a 31-color palette.
            </p>
            <p>
                This process succeeded for 1,133 products; the rest failed due to missing images or 
                download errors. The chart below shows sample products with their extracted colors, 
                including some errors where background elements skewed the results.
            </p>

            Sample products with extracted dominant colors. Some extractions are noisy—the Lacoste cologne 
            is labeled male but extracted colors include pink/salmon from the background.

    <!-- COLOR ANALYSIS -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Color Patterns</h2>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            The charts below show color distributions in explicitly gendered products and the 
            LASSO coefficients indicating which colors predict each gender class.
        </p>

        <div class="viz-container" style="background: #1a1a2e; padding: 1rem;">
            <img src="UK pink tax/Outputs/charts/validation/color_distribution_by_gender.png" alt="Color distribution by gender" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 4px;">
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 0.9rem; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            Color frequency in products with explicit gender labels. Sample sizes are small (n=32 each).
        </p>

        <div class="viz-container" style="background: #1a1a2e; padding: 1rem;">
            <img src="UK pink tax/Outputs/charts/validation/color_importance.png" alt="Color importance for gender prediction" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 4px;">
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 0.9rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
            LASSO coefficients from a binary female/male classifier. Positive values predict female; 
            negative values predict male.
        </p>

        <div class="theory-box" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <p>
                The patterns match expectations: pinks, purples, and lavender are associated with 
                female products; black, brown, and navy with male products. However, some results 
                are less intuitive—tan has a strong female coefficient, possibly due to foundation 
                and cosmetics packaging.
            </p>
            <p>
                These associations reflect marketing conventions rather than any inherent property 
                of the colors. The classifier learns what retailers do, not what they should do.

        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
            Gradient boosting performed best, likely because it handles sparse features and missing 
            values (many products lack color data) without requiring imputation.
        </p>

        <div class="theory-box" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h3>Validation Against Human Labels</h3>
            <p>
                The test set above uses labels derived from explicit text patterns, which may not 
                reflect how humans would categorize products. A stricter test uses 256 products 
                with independent human labels.
            </p>

        <div class="theory-box" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <p>
                The combined model (breadcrumbs + descriptions + colors) achieves 84.4% accuracy 
                against human labels. Breadcrumbs alone reach 77.3%, performing well on neutral 
                products (99%) but poorly on female products (57%). Description-only performs 
                worst at 60.8%.
            </p>
            <p>
                The confusion matrices show the model is conservative—it tends to predict "neutral" 
                when uncertain, leading to under-classification of gendered products.

                Brand names are strong predictors: "Venus" for female, "Lynx" and "Gillette" for male. 
                Category breadcrumbs also encode gender—UK retailers place "toiletries" in male-coded 
                sections and "shaving hair removal" in female-coded sections, even for similar products.
            </p>

                The neutral class is predicted by genuinely ungendered categories (toothpaste, conditioner) 
                and marketplace listings, which tend to have less structured metadata.

        <h2 class="section-title">Estimating the Pink Tax</h2>

        <div class="theory-box">
            <h3>Prior Research</h3>
            <p>
                The "pink tax" refers to the observation that consumer products marketed toward women 
                are often priced higher than comparable products aimed at men. Research on the topic 
                has produced mixed findings. Gonzalez Guittar et al. (2022) studied over 3,000 products 
                and found some evidence of a premium on specific items such as deodorants and lotions, 
                though men paid more for shaving products. Moshary et al. (2023), using Nielsen scanner 
                data with product ingredient controls, concluded that price gaps largely reflect 
                differences in product composition rather than discriminatory pricing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both studies agree that gender segmentation in consumer products is widespread, but 
                diverge on whether the resulting price differences constitute a "tax" or simply reflect 
                product differentiation. This analysis contributes to the question using UK grocery data, 
                testing whether a female price premium persists after progressively controlling for 
                product category, store, and product characteristics.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="theory-box">
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
                With the classification pipeline providing gender labels, the next step is to 
                estimate the price differential between female- and male-targeted products. The 
                analysis uses log-transformed prices as the dependent variable, which means coefficients 
                can be interpreted as approximate percentage differences. All regressions use 
                heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors (HC1).
            </p>
            <p>
                The key question is whether the female coefficient remains significant as controls are 
                added. If the gap disappears after controlling for product category, it suggests 
                composition effects (women's products fall in different price ranges) rather than 
                within-category pricing discrimination.

                The R² jump from 0.006 to 0.672 when adding category fixed effects is the key result. 
                Product category explains the vast majority of price variation. The raw negative gap 
                arises because female-targeted products are concentrated in lower-priced categories 
                (personal care, period products) while male-targeted products span a wider price range 
                (including grooming sets and premium razors). Within the same category, there is no 
                statistically detectable difference.

                This aligns with Moshary et al.'s conclusion that price differences between gendered

                OLS estimates the effect on the conditional mean. Quantile regression tests whether 
                the gap differs across the price distribution. Without category controls, the gap 
                is significantly negative at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles (female products 
                are 12–20% cheaper), but zero at the 25th and 75th percentiles. With category 
                controls, the pattern reverses at the bottom of the distribution: at the 10th and 
                25th percentiles, female products are 25–43% more expensive within the same category 
                (p &lt; 0.001), while the gap is zero at higher quantiles.

                The controlled quantile results suggest that the cheapest female products within a 
                category tend to be priced higher than the cheapest male equivalents. This could 
                reflect a floor-price effect — budget female products start at a higher baseline, 
                even if median and premium products are priced similarly. However, the small 
                number of categories and products within each means these estimates should be 
                treated cautiously.

                Running the raw-gap regression separately by store reveals substantial heterogeneity. 
                One retailer (Morrisons) shows a large and significant female discount of 18.6% 
                (p &lt; 0.001), while the other two stores show no significant gap. A female × store 
                interaction model confirms this: the interaction for Morrisons is significant (p &lt; 0.001) 
                with a total female effect of −50.6%, while the other stores show no significant 
                interaction.

                intimate care. Male products cluster in toiletries, deodorants, razors, and skincare. 
                These categories have different baseline price levels, which drives the raw price gap.

    <!-- CONCLUSIONS -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Conclusions</h2>

        <div class="theory-box">
            <h3>On Classification</h3>
            <p>
                The classifier reaches 80% F1 (gradient boosting) on the test set and 72% agreement 
                with independent human labels. Text features (category breadcrumbs and description TF-IDF) 
                carry most of the predictive signal, with color features adding a modest +2.3 percentage 
                points. The model is conservative — it under-classifies gendered products rather than 
                over-classifying neutral ones.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="theory-box">
            <h3>On Pricing</h3>
            <p>
                The regression analysis finds no evidence of a systematic pink tax at the aggregate 
                level. Female products are 9–10% cheaper in raw comparisons, and the gap becomes 
                statistically insignificant (and reverses sign to +3.7%) after controlling for product 
                category. The unit price regression shows no difference at all (+0.7%, p = 0.92).
            </p>
            <p>
                Within categories, results are mixed: greeting cards show a small female premium, 
                shower products show a male premium, and most categories have too few gendered 
                products for meaningful comparison. The quantile regression suggests a possible 
                floor-price effect for the cheapest products within a category, but the evidence 
                is limited by sample size.
            </p>
            <p>
                These findings are consistent with the prior literature. As in Moshary et al. (2023), 
                the apparent price gap is largely a composition effect — female and male products fall 
                into different categories with different price levels — rather than within-category 
                discrimination. The meaningful finding is the extent of gender segmentation itself, 
                not the prices.

    <!-- LIMITATIONS -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Limitations</h2>
        
        <div class="theory-box">
            <p>
                <strong>Gender labeling:</strong> Products are classified using explicit keyword 
                matching and a trained classifier. Both approaches miss implicitly gendered products — items 
                marketed toward a gender through color, imagery, or brand positioning without using 
                explicit terms. The human-coded sample (259 products) showed that keyword-based labels 
                miss roughly 23% of gendered products.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Category granularity:</strong> Only 11 product categories had sufficient 
                products of both genders for within-category comparison. Finer-grained categories 
                would improve comparability but reduce sample sizes further.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Product equivalence:</strong> The regression controls for category and 
                description text, but does not account for product quality, ingredients, or size 
                beyond what unit price captures. A "women's razor" and a "men's razor" in the same 
                breadcrumb category may differ in blade count, handle design, or packaging, which 
                could justify price differences.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Color data coverage:</strong> Color features are available only for 
                Morrisons products (~5,600 of 12,800). Tesco and ASDA image URLs had expired 
                at the time of extraction. Color-based findings should be interpreted with this 
                coverage limitation in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Retailer scope:</strong> The data covers three UK grocery retailers. 
                Results may not generalise to other product categories (clothing, electronics) 
                or other markets.
