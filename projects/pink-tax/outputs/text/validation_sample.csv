4053,311221620,Sure Maximum Protection Clean Scent Antiperspirant Deodorant 150ml,"Sure Maximum Protection Clean Scent Anti-perspirant Deodorant Aerosol 150 ml is our most powerful anti-perspirant deodorant yet, providing long-lasting, advanced protection against sweat and odour. It's 3x more powerful* on sweat and odour, yet gentle enough for everyday use to keep you feeling fresh, dry and confident for 96 hours. The patented Microtechnology forms a microshield across your sweat glands, tackling sweat and odour at its source while the innovative MotionSense technology releases bursts of fresh, clean fragrance, so you can keep going. It works like this: unique microcapsules sit on the surface of your skin. When you move, friction breaks those microcapsules releasing more fragrance. So, the more you move, the more it protects. That clean, fresh scent stays with you no matter how hard you push yourself. Because when you work hard, Sure works harder. Sure. It won't let you down. It's your new everyday must-have. Whether youâre working hard in the office, playing hard out and about or just meeting up with friends, Sure Maximum Protection anti-perspirant deodorant for women will give you all the backup you need. How to use: Apply it once for all-day protection in the morning or at night. For optimum protection, use this anti-perspirant deodorant spray at night when your sweat glands are less active. Firstly, shake the can. Then hold it 15 centimetres away from your underarm and spray evenly in a well-ventilated area. Avoid contact with eyes and broken skin.*vs Sure basic anti-perspirant deodorant aerosol","{'bc1': 'Health & Beauty', 'bc2': '""Womens Toiletries""', 'bc3': 'Deodorants', 'bc4': '""Womens Antiperspirant""'}",https://digitalcontent.api.tesco.com/v2/media/ghs/cb7661e9-c497-433a-a31f-324e1aee3dfa/c4171be9-6164-4199-85a7-df4cb325c40a_177923976.jpeg?h=225&w=225,https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/311221620,5.0,female,male,0.3913105463286578,0.5804755729977733,0.028213880673568868,0.5804755729977733,,,
